This "system-tests" directory was created to hold software products that are
being developed to run tests on the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) software.

The initial plan for such products was to create an automated application that
could build one or more GMI executables, run them using standardized test cases,
compare the output files against the pre-validated results expected for each
test case, and fully automate all these actions to the maximum extent possible.

Ideally, we would like to develop tools of this nature that can be launched on
as many different system architectures as are supported by the GMI project.

Hence, the name "system-tests" implies that this development area contains
software for testing GMI functionalities for multiple types of systems.

Directories found directly below the "system-tests" level will be used to
hold each unique type of testing tool being developed for the GMI project.

The first tool that motivated the creation of this directory was a prototype
pre-release of a series of programs known as the "gmi-exam" suite of automated
software, which is used to examine the validity of upgrades to the GMI software.

As of 12/01/2005, the "gmi-exam" software (although still under testing and
development) was able to use the NCCS Compaq system named Halem to automatically
check out the GMI code, build it, execute it, test its results, and deliver an
email summary of the test cases' success/failure results to the user.

This software was developed by the Advanced Software Technology Group of the
Software Integration and Visualization Office (ASTG/SIVO), NASA GSFC Code 610.3,
and is contained in the directory named "gmi-exam".
