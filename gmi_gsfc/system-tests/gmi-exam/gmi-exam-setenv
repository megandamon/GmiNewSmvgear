#
#  gmi-exam-setenv : Used to prepare a user's C Shell environment for building
#                    executables for the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) code.
#_______________________________________________________________________________
#
#  Usage:            This is a sourceable file that was designed to reduce the
#                    dependencies upon modifications users were formerly told to
#                    make to their C shell .cshrc and .login user startup files.
#
#                    The original GMI code made a large number of changes to the
#                    user's environment, including many changes to the "cdpath",
#                    as seen below, and the introduction of numerous aliases.
#
#                    This code is designed to provide users with a way of
#                    controlling when such changes are invoked, and represents
#                    a much more abbreviated version of the changes formerly
#                    invoked via files named .cshrc.ggmi and .login.ggmi.
#
#                    To use this code, create a directory that will hold the
#                    GMI directory named "gem" and a few other directories,
#                    and set the environment variable GMIROOT to the location
#                    of the upper level directory holding "gem".
#
#                    Next, run:  source  gmi-exam-setenv
#
#                    Upon completion, you then only need to define the type of
#                    chemistry to use for your executable by setting CHEMCASE,
#                    and proceed to run the make commands needed to build it.

#
#  Related Code:     This product may be used interactively, or even sourced
#                    from your C shell startups (if you wish), but it was mainly
#                    designed to be called one time during the execution of a
#                    chain of scripts in the the suite of "gmi-exam" software.
#
#                    Related modules include:
#
#  gmi-exam-cvs-co   -  Used to check out GMI modules from CVS into $GMIROOT.
#
#  gmi-exam-builder  -  Driver script used to build one or more executables.
