#  aero_dao : Run options for GMI problem_name = aero_dao
#_______________________________________________________________________________
#
#  This input file was created from a template that uses a specific format.
#
#  It is used by one of a series of scripts that automatically build and execute
#  standardized test cases for the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) software.
#
#  Each test case has a unique "problem name", and uses ASCII I/O files that
#  incorporate that name as part of their file name.  The options that apply to
#  the resources, file names, cost centers, etc. to be used when running each
#  test case are defined in this simple input file.  These options are used to
#  build and store a customized script in a directory dedicated to each test.
#
#  Note that input values seen here must remain in THE EXACT ORDER SHOWN BELOW.
#
#  The programs that read "input options and definitions" such as those
#  seen below are designed to ignore any line that begins (IN COLUMN 1) with the
#  symbol commonly referred to as a pound sign, number sign, or crosshatch (#).
#
#  This simple approach was chosen due to the fact that the automated code was
#  written as a prototype, and prepared as quickly as possible to provide the
#  GMI developers with a simple way to run tests to check the basic validity
#  of the software following upgrades made to the GMI CVS repository.
#
#  The automated code is stored in a self-contained directory "skeleton" in CVS
#  to allow developers to check out a "fresh copy" at any time and rebuild anew.
#
#  When running the full chain of scripts, they are capable of automatically
#  checking out the code from CVS, building the GMI executables, building and
#  running batch jobs for each test case in their own directory, and collecting
#  a summary of the pass/fail results and emailing that summary to the user.
#
#  If failures occur, the batch job scripts and input files remain in place,
#  and can then be "tweaked" by the developer and manually rerun as needed.
#
#  Since the chain of automated code was built as a series of nested programs,
#  parts of them can be run independently if you are familiar with the code, and
#  some of them can be run interactively, but this product is primarily intended
#  to be used to run batch/background jobs.  Once again, keep in mind that this
#  is a prototype which may be enhanced later.  Although it offers a convenient
#  way to test the code, you still need to check the results carefully.
#
#  Listed below are the options that are needed at this time.
#  Each input option appears below a "comment line" describing its relevance.
