#  testcases :  Input data defining the GMI tests that gmi-exam-driver will run.
#_______________________________________________________________________________
#
#  This input file defines the GMI "problem_name" for each test case that the
#  suite of "gmi-exam" test programs will run for a given chemical mechanism.
#
#  The "gmi-exam" code uses the names specified here to locate other input files
#  that further control the options that will be applied to each automated test.
#
#  Specify one or more chemistry types, one per line, in this file 
#  with no leading or trailing whitespace characters on the input lines.
#
#  This simple design was used to quickly develop a set of programs that
#  will automatically build GMI code and verifying its validity by running a
#  series of standard tests and comparing their output to the expected results.
#
#  The programs that read "input options and definitions" such as those
#  seen below are designed to ignore any line that begins (IN COLUMN 1) with the
#  symbol commonly referred to as a pound sign, number sign, or crosshatch (#).
#
#  All other lines that do not begin with the # character are considered
#  to be input definitions that will control the test runs, and in this case,
#  are simply the names that will be used to locate other input files in the
#  "Test-plans" directory, and to locate the files in the Namelist directory
#  which will be needed by the "gem" executable for each test run.
