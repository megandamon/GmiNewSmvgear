#  chemtypes :  Input data defining types of GMI test programs to be built/run.
#_______________________________________________________________________________
#
#  This input file defines the chemical mechanisms that will be used when the
#  suite of "gmi-exam" test programs build a set of unique "gem executables".
#
#  It is also used later to define which types of tests will be executed.
#
#  Specify one or more chemistry types, one per line, in this file
#  with no leading or trailing whitespace characters on the input lines.
#
#  This simple design was used to quickly develop a set of programs that 
#  will automatically build GMI code and verifying its validity by running a
#  series of standard tests and comparing their output to the expected results.
#
#  The programs that read "input options and definitions" such as those
#  seen below are designed to ignore any line that begins (IN COLUMN 1) with the
#  symbol commonly referred to as a pound sign, number sign, or crosshatch (#).
#
#  All other lines that do not begin with the # character are considered
#  to be input definitions that will control the test runs, and in this case,
#  are simply the names that will be passed to the code as $CHEMTYPE during
#  each test run of the "gem" executables.
