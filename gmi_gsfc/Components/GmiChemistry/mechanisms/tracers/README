Summary of the tracers in this "mechanism":

====
Age:

 Tracer emitted for first 30 days from 10N to 10S, surface to 800 hPa - set to 1.0
 After 30 days the source region becomes a sink region - set to 0.0

====
e90:
 
 e90 emitted at the surface such that the global burden is 100ppbv
 e90 loss is 90 day efold time
 
====
tm25:

 Tracer is fixed in the stratosphere to 200ppbv
 Tropopause determined by function: P = 230-148*(cos(lat))**4 (units: hPa) => P_tropopause = 82 hPa at the equator and 230 hPa at the poles
 tm25 destroyed with 25 day efold time in "troposphere"

====
Radon/Lead:

 Radon emitted over land (1 atoms/cm^2/s), limited by temperature (273K drops emission to 0.6 atoms/cm^2/s) and snow/ice cover eliminate emission
 Radon emitted over ocean (0.005 atoms/cm^2/s)
 Radon decayed to lead with an efold time of 5.5 days
 Radon washed out (hstar=.0093)
 Lead settled out as aerosol

====
Beryllium 7 and 10 and stratospheric Beryllium 7 and 10:

 Tracers emitted according to a function that depends on latitude and pressure (Koch table) 
 Beryllium 7 decayed to boron (not carried) with an efold time of 53.3 days
 Beryllium 10 decayed to boron (not carried) with an efold time of 5.84d8 days
 Beryllium 7 and 10 settled out as aerosols

====
CH3I: 

 Tracer emitted over oceans (1 molecule/cm^2/s)
 Decayed with an efold time of 5 days
 CH3I washed out (hstar=.14)

====
fCO2: 

 Emitted at the surface according to Prather's data
 CO2 washed out (hstar=.036)

====
Linoz:

 Linearized ozone parameterization.

====
Synoz:

 Synthetic ozone emitted in the tropical lower stratosphere - 30N to 30S, 10 to 70 hPa
 Source flux of 550 Tg/yr
 synoz lost at the surface - relaxed to 2.5e-8 with 2 day time

====
SF6:

 SF6 parameterized chemistry. 
 Emitted at surface 
 Loss is through photolysis and O1D (read in parameters)

====
CLOCK:

 Add timestep (units: days) everywhere and set bottom layer to 0.0 every time step

====
Uniform:

 Tracer emitted uniformly at surface.
 Tracer decays with 25 day efold
 Surface emissions of 2400 Tg/yr.

====
Strat_O3:

 Stratospheric ozone fixed according to previous full chem run (read in)
 troposphere (determined from e90) has parameterized loss using O1D, H2O, OH, and HO2
   from full chem run results and no sources
